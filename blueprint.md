# Project Blueprint: Messaging App

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a real-time messaging application using React and Firebase.

## Features

*   **Real-time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages in real-time.
*   **User Authentication:** Users can sign in or create an account through a dedicated, styled login page.
*   **Message History:** Chat history is loaded from the Realtime Database.
*   **Friends List:** Users can see a list of other users to start private conversations.

## Implemented Features

*   **Firebase Backend:** The project is connected to a Firebase project using the **Realtime Database**.
*   **Modular & Reusable Components:**
    *   **`App.jsx`:** Main application component that handles routing and authentication context.
    *   **`Auth.jsx`:** A user-friendly authentication component with separate forms for sign-in and sign-up, and improved error handling.
    *   **`Chat.jsx`:** A refactored chat component that uses a `useChat` hook for message handling and separate components for the message list and input.
    *   **`Friends.jsx`:** A component that displays a list of users, allowing the current user to initiate a chat.
    *   **`Layout.jsx`:** A layout component that provides a consistent structure for the application, including a dynamic icon bar and sidebar.
    *   **`IconBar.jsx`:** A reusable component for the application's navigation icons.
    *   **`Sidebar.jsx`:** A component that dynamically displays the user's direct messages and profile information.
*   **Custom Hooks for Logic Reusability:**
    *   **`useAuth`:** Encapsulates authentication logic, making it easy to access user state throughout the application.
    *   **`useFriends`:** Manages the fetching and state of the user's friends list.
    *   **`useChat`:** Handles all chat-related functionality, including fetching and sending messages.
*   **Protected Routes:** A `ProtectedRoute` component ensures that only authenticated users can access the main application.
*   **Improved User Experience:**
    *   The authentication flow is more intuitive, with clear error messages.
    *   The UI is more organized and visually appealing.

## Current Plan

With the core application refactored and in a much more maintainable state, the next steps will focus on adding new features and further improving the user experience.

1.  **User Profile:** Implement a user profile page where users can update their display name and profile picture.
2.  **Private Messaging:** Fully implement private messaging between users.
3.  **Add Friend Functionality:** Allow users to add and remove friends from their friends list.
4.  **Testing:**
    *   Write tests for the new hooks (`useAuth`, `useFriends`, `useChat`).
    *   Write tests for the refactored components.
